The following changes were applied to the OpenOCD master branch:

[2015-05-11]

- the three separate build scripts were deprecated, and a single script,
using Docker, was added to the main gnuarmeclipse-se.git/scripts.

- the greeting shows 32-bits or 64-bits (plural for bits).


[2015-03-22]

- the NSIS script was fixed to prevent removing the keys when 
uninstalling an older version.


[2015-03-18]

- the build scripts were extended to generate both the stable and the 
development version.

- multiple versions of the package can be installed in separate folders, 
named using the version.

- for Windows, more accurate keys were stored, so remember separate locations 
for 32/64-bit versions.


[2015-01-30]

- gnuarmeclipse

All GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD build related files were grouped under this folder.

- README.md

Markdown files were added in all new folders, to improve the look when browsed
in the SourceForge Git web browser.


[2015-01-12]

- src/openocd.c

Add branding 'GNU ARM Eclipse' to the greeting message, to 
more easily identify this custom version.

- helper/options.c

Update the logic used to locate the 'scripts' folder, by 
using the argv[0], as on Windows. The logic is a bit more
complicated, to accomodate 3 cases (no path, relative path
and absolute path).
